      <description>Hi there ðŸ‘‹ !
I&amp;rsquo;m NotTurtle (or NotTurtle01, as u prefer), thrilled to share a bit about myself with you. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the traditional whoami and what I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about.
I am currently studying Artificial Intelligence (AI) ðŸ‘¾ and have just begun my journey in this exciting field. My most frequently-used language would be Python and HTML-CSS to do some basic web-development work.
In the short term I would like to learn how to handle databases better, reinforce my (limited for now) knowledge in networks and learn more about neural networks and machine-learning.</description>
